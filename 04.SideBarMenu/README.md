# Side Bar Menu

> [!NOTE]
> A sidebar menu is a user interface element commonly used in websites and applications to provide navigation options. It is typically positioned on the left or right side of the screen and can contain links, icons, or buttons that allow users to navigate to different sections or features of the site or app. Sidebar menus can be either static (always visible) or collapsible (expandable and retractable), depending on the design and user experience goals.
