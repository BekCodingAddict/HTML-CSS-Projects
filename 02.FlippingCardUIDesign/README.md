# Flipping Card

> [!NOTE]
> Flipping credit card UI design refers to a user interface design pattern where the visual representation of a credit card flips or rotates to reveal additional information or perform an action when interacted with. This design technique is often used in digital wallet applications, e-commerce websites, or banking apps to provide users with a dynamic and engaging experience when managing their credit card information.For example, when a user hovers over or taps on a credit card image, it may flip around to display the card's backside, revealing additional details such as the cardholder's name, expiration date, CVV number, or other relevant information. Additionally, the flipping animation can be utilized to simulate actions like making a payment or activating a card.Overall, flipping credit card UI design adds interactivity and functionality to the user experience, making it more intuitive and visually appealing.
