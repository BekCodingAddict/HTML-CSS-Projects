# HTML-CSS-Projects
- HTML and CSS projects involve creating web pages and web applications using two fundamental technologies for building the structure and styling of web content. Hereâ€™s an overview of what each term means and how they are typically used in projects:

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- HTML is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages. It defines the elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other types of content. HTML uses tags  to denote different types of content and their hierarchy.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- CSS is the language used to describe the presentation of HTML elements on a web page. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual appearance of the web page. CSS can be written directly in HTML files using <style> tags, or it can be included in external stylesheet files.
